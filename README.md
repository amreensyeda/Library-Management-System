  </li>
  <li>
    These Systems comprises of information regarding Books, where we can perform all the operations that are required in an actual system such as CRUD operation, advanced search, book issuing, and also to store the information within files using the process known as Serialization.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Operations Performed in Library Management System</h4>
<ul>
  <li>We'll be accepting data (book and user details) to be stored.</li>
  <li>We'll be adding the functionality to retrieve book details.</li>
  <li>The admin login session will be emulated via the command line.</li>
  <li>Only during the admin login session can a user be issued a book.</li>
  <li>All of the data will be stored in encrypted format in text files to escape the initial volatile nature of the application.</li>
